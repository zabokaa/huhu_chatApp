## chat app setup guide
HUHU üôÉ this guide will walk you through the steps required to set up the development environment, configure the database, and install the necessary libraries to run the app.
- clone the repository
- install dependencies: all used libraries for that chat app (e.g. react-native-gifted-chat, expo-image-picker, .. ) are already included in the package.json file and will be installed automatically when you run `npm install`
- create database https://firebase.google.com/ (ensure in the ‚ÄúRules‚Äù tab the function is set to `allow read, write: if true;`).
- don't forget to update App.js with your personal firebaseConfig !
- run the app `npx expo start`
- that's it !
- you should now have the Chat App up and running on your development machine. if you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out for support
- Happy chatting ! üöÄ
